This folder includes produced figures. 

# PHO5_draft1.png
- The first try of making a nucleosome occupancy plot for the promoter region of gene *PHO5*. Not used in the final report.
- basic plotting system
- Promoter position vs the nucleosome occupancy data in No Pi
- Genomic position is the raw position; no motif mapped

# PHO5_02.png
- This is one of the two figures used in the final report. It is to plot the nucleosome occupancy in No Pi for the gene *PHO5*. 
- ggplot2 plotting based
- Promoter position vs the nucleosome occupancy data in No Pi
- With motifs mapped and colored. Position labeled relatively.


# PHO5_03.png
- This is one of the two figures used in the final report. It is to plot the nucleosome occupancy in High Pi for the gene *PHO5*. 
- ggplot2 plotting based
- Promoter position vs the nucleosome occupancy data in High Pi
- With motifs mapped and colored. Position labeled relatively.
