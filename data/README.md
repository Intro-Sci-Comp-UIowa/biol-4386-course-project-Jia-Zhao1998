(He et al, 2017)\
Strain: K699 (W303)\
Binding sites of CgPho4 and ScPho4 in _S. cerevisiae_ background: 115, 74, respectively
## GSM730535_WT_NoPi_Nucleosome.wig.gz
 (Xu 2011)\
Strain: W303\
Nucleosome occupancy data of WT No Pi in WIG format\
Alignment: Sequence reads were obtained and mapped to the S. cerevisiae (2003) genomes using the Illumina Genome Analyzer Pipeline. All reads uniquely mapping with two or fewer mismatches were retained and read starts were summed in sliding windows of 80 bp to create summary windows.
Paired-end Data: the average insert size for WT_NoPi_Nucleosome is 154 bp, with standard deviation of 22.8 bp\
